# Daily-Planner

## Description

Plan out your day, by the hour!
This Daily-Planner can save your daily to-do's and updates the current time so you know whether you're behind schedule or not.

With this project I learned how to use APIs to update and style my application
depending on the current hour. I learned how to use the local storage to set and get values. I also learned and still learning how to use jQuery.

APIs used
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- dayJS
- fontawesome & google font (was already included and didnt interact with them)

## Usage

Plan out your day!
- Type out your to-do's depending on your plans for that day. 
- Make sure to save your plans for every hour
- Time-Management accomplished!
